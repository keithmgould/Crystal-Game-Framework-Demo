Major Todo:
- Add and adhere to a "widget API", aka Nicholas Z's "sandbox" (facade pattern)

Strategy:
- Common code stored in public/js/

Current Goal:
- 1) Get Box2D running on server.
- 2) Get commands to a) update client b) sent up to server
- 3) Get server to send down snapshots (when necessary)
- 4) Get client to update based on snapshot
- There are lots of problems with this but its a fantastic start...

Box2D Components refresher:
- Body: have mass nd velocity
- Shape: collision geometry attached to bodies.  used to define mass of body. have friction and restitution.  shapes owned by bodies.
- Fixture: binds shapes to bodies.
