Major Todo:
- Add and adhere to a "widget API", aka Nicholas Z's "sandbox" (facade pattern)

Strategy:
- Common code stored in public/js/

Current Goal:
- 1) DONE! Show Lag
- 2) Show running avg for update frequency 

Box2D Components refresher:
- Body: have mass nd velocity
- Shape: collision geometry attached to bodies.  used to define mass of body. have friction and restitution.  shapes owned by bodies.
- Fixture: binds shapes to bodies.

Timing refresher:
- FPS (Hz): (frames per second): frequency canvas is repainted (drawn).  This is usually called (and thusly tied) to the update frequency
- Box2D Step (Hz):  Tells how many steps happen per second.  Or, how much "time" should pass in the simulation during one step.  The smaller 
  the number, the more time passes per step.  so 60/60 would mean 1 second per step.  1/60 would mean 1/60th of a second per step.
- Update (hz): How often we call world.Step and draw.
