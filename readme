Major Todo:
- Add and adhere to a "widget API", aka Nicholas Z's "sandbox" (facade pattern)

Current Goal:
- Get proper syncing between server and client
- Use syncing to eliminate jerkyness on client


Box2D Components refresher:
- Body: has mass and velocity
- Shape: collision geometry attached to bodies.  used to define mass of body. have friction and restitution.  shapes owned by bodies.
- Fixture: binds shapes to bodies.

Timing refresher:
- FPS (Hz): (frames per second): frequency canvas is repainted (drawn).  This is usually called (and thusly tied) to the update frequency
- Box2D Step (Hz):  Tells how many steps happen per second.  Or, how much "time" should pass in the simulation during one step.  The smaller 
  the number, the more time passes per step.  so 60/60 would mean 1 second per step.  1/60 would mean 1/60th of a second per step.
- Update (hz): How often we call world.Step and draw.
