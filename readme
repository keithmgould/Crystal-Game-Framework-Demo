Major Todo:
- Add and adhere to a "widget API", aka Nicholas Z's "sandbox" (facade pattern)

Strategy:
- Common code stored in public/js/

Current Goal:
- 0) DONE! Box2D running on server.
- 1) DONE! Client requests and pulls down registered SelfShip.  SelfShip has a long unguessable hash...
- 2) DONE! Commands to a) update client b) sent up to server
- 3) DONE! Server to send down snapshots (when necessary)
- 4) DONE! Client ships to update based on snapshot
- 5) DONE! Delete ship on socket disconnect
- 6) DONE! Client ships to destroy if "enemy" leaves the "game"
- 8) DONE! Client Stops and alerts user if connection to server lost
- There are lots of problems with this but its a fantastic start...

Box2D Components refresher:
- Body: have mass nd velocity
- Shape: collision geometry attached to bodies.  used to define mass of body. have friction and restitution.  shapes owned by bodies.
- Fixture: binds shapes to bodies.
